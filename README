		WHAM - Weighted Histogram Analysis Method

Overview
========

This program implements Weighted Histogram Analysis Method.

WHAM allows you to calculate the Potential of Mean Force from a series of
constrained molecular dynamics simulations. The algorithm used in this program
is described in reference [1].


Installation
============

The package uses conventional GNU installation scheme

	./configure && make && sudo make install

Please read the file INSTALL for detailed installation instructions.


Program Options
===============

To obtain the description of program options use the following command

	wham --help


Input Format Description
========================

Input data is assumed to be in free format (white space is not meaningful)
with the following data included:

	Integer (m)
		Number of windows.

	Repeat (m) times:

		Floating point
			The coordinate value of the center of biasing
			potential for the current window (this value is
			named x0 in the expression below).

		Floating point
			The value of biasing constant (this value is named
			k in the expression below).

		Integer (n)
			Number of data points.

		Repeat (n) times:

			Floating point
				Distribution of the coordinate for the
				current window (this value is named x in the
				expression below).

For example see test files in tests directory.

The biasing potential used in molecular dynamic simulations is assumed to
be in standard quadratic form:

	U = 1/2 * k * (x - x0) * (x - x0)

Be sure to account for 1/2 in front of the biasing constant in case your
biasing potential does not include it.
